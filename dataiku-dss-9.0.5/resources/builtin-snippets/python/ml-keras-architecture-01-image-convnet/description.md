A convolutional architecture that will classify images.

This architecture requires at least several hundreds of training images per class to start having predicting capabilities. If your dataset does not contain enough images, you should consider doing data augmentation or using a pre-trained model.

Do not forget to apply the default Keras preprocessing on your image feature.
