Perform a "list-datasets" API call on the DSS Public API.

This sample demonstrates how to access the full DSS public API, even method not directly included in the dataiku client library.

Warning: for this sample to work, you'll need to add the READ_CONF project-level privilege to the API key associated to the webapp (in the Project settings, ie. not in the Webapp settings).

For more information, please see the DSS API doc
