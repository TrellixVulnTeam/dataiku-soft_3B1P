            This can be caused by an extreme imbalance between classes

        <h1>Probabilities and lift</h1>
        <p> A binary classifier produces a probability that a given record is "positive" (here, that
            <code ng-bind="modelData.coreParams.target_variable" /> is <code ng-bind="modelData.classes[1]" />).<br />
            The <strong>lift</strong> is the <strong>ratio</strong>
            between the results of this model and the results obtained with a random model.<br />
            Lift curves are particularly useful for "targeting" kinds of problems
            (churn prevention, marketing campaign targeting, ...)</p>

        <h1>Cumulative Lift Curve</h1>
        <p> The goal of this curve is to visualize the benefits of using a model for targeting a subset
            of the population. On the horizontal axis, we show the percentage of the population which is
            targeted and on the vertical axis the percentage of found positive records.</p>
        <p> The <strong style="color: {{colors[ys.length-1]}}">dotted diagonal</strong> illustrates a
            random model (i.e., targeting 40% of the population will find 40% of the positive records).</p>
        <p> The <strong style="color: {{colors[ys.length-2]}}">wizard curve above</strong> shows a perfect
            model (there are {{ 100 * modelData.perf.liftVizData.wizard.positives /
                modelData.perf.liftVizData.wizard.total | number:0 }}% positive records in your test set,
            so a perfect model would target only this)</p>
        <p> <span ng-if="ys.length &lt;= 3"><strong style="color: {{colors[0]}}">This curve</strong> shows</span>
            <span ng-if="ys.length &gt; 3"><strong>The other curves</strong> (one per fold) show</span>
            the actual percentage of actual positives found by this model. The steeper the curve, the better.</p>

        <h1>Per-bin lift chart</h1>
        <p> This chart sorts the observations by deciles of decreasing predicted probability.
            It shows the <strong>lift</strong> in each of the bins.</p>
        <p> If there is 20% of positives in your test set, but 60% in the first bin of probability then the
            lift of this first bin is 3.<br />
            This means that targeting only the observations in this bin would yield 3 times as many positive
            results as a random sampling (equally sized bars at the level of the dotted line).</p>
        <p> The bars should decrease progressively from left to right, and the higher the bars on the left,
            the better.</p>
