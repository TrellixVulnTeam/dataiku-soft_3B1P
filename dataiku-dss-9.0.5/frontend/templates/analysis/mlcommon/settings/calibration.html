                    Probability calibration helps adjust the predicted probabilities to the actual class frequencies.
                    <br/>
                    It should only be used if the problem involves actual probabilities of events, not just the ordering of these probabilities (ranking).
                    <br/>
                    For instance, upon predicting some probability of the positive class occurring, non-calibrated models can underestimate or overestimate the actual frequency of the positive class occurring, which can lead to suboptimal decisions.
                    <br/>
                    Calibrated models can be especially useful when the predicted probabilities are used to compute expectations of another quantity.
                    <br/>
                    Note that isotonic regression is more prone to overfitting and metrics alteration than Platt scaling.
