    <div data-block="algorithm-description">
        <p><strong>Naive Bayes</strong> is a basic classification algorithm, which classifies examples by making strong conditional independence assumptions. More precisely, it supposes that given a class, the features are independent from each other. Applying Baye's formula yields a simple model which can be trained in linear time.</p>

        <p>Large numbers of features or classes may lead to sparsity and numerical instability. It is therefore recommended to define a <em>smoothing parameter</em> for the model, which acts as a "pseudo count" and regularizes the model.
        <br />
        <b>Note</b>: Naive Bayes only accepts categorical and text features.</p>
