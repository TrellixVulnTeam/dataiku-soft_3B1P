        <p><strong>Ordinary Least Squares</strong> or <strong>Linear Least Squares</strong> is the simplest algorithm for linear regression.</p>
        <p>The target variable is computed as the sum of weighted input variables. OLS finds the appropriate weights by minimizing the <em>cost function</em> (i.e., how "wrong" the algorithm is).
        <br /> OLS is very simple and provides a very "explainable" model, but:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                it cannot automatically fit data for which the target variable is not the result of a linear combination of input features
            </li>
            <li>
                it is highly sensitive to errors in the input dataset and prone to overfitting
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note that in DSS, OLS is actually regularized (this is the scikit-learn / scipy behavior)</strong> </p>
