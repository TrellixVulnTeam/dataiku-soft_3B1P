        Random Forest
    </div>
    <div data-block="algorithm-description">
        <p>A <strong>Random Forest</strong> is made of many decision trees. Each tree in the forest predicts a record,  and each tree "votes" for the final answer of the forest.<br />
        The forest chooses the class having the most votes.
        </p>
        <p>
        A decision tree is a simple algorithm which builds a decision tree. Each node of the decision tree includes a condition on one of the input features.
        </p>
        <p>
        When "growing" (ie, training) the forest:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>for each tree, a random sample of the training set is used;</li>
            <li>for each decision point in the tree, a random subset of the input features is considered.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Random Forests generally provide good results, at the expense of "explainability" of the model.</p>
