        Gaussian Mixture (MLLib)

    <div data-block="algorithm-description">
        The Gaussian Mixture Model models the distribution of the data as a "mixture" of several populations, each of which can be described by a single multivariate normal distribution. An example of such a distribution is that of sizes among adults, which is described by the mixture of two distributions: the sizes of men, and those of women, each of which is approximately described by a normal distribution.

                <div class="help-inline">
                    The maximum number of iterations to learn the model. The Gaussian Mixture model uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which is iterative, each iteration running on all of the data. A higher value of this parameter will lead to a longer running time, but a more precise clustering. A value between 10 and 100 is recommended.
